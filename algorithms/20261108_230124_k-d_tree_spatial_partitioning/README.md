# K-D Tree Spatial Partitioning and Nearest Neighbor Search

Core **C++** implementation for **K-D Tree Spatial Partitioning and Nearest Neighbor Search**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `C++` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Balanced Hierarchical Indexing` using `Node Pointers & Self-Balancing Trees`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: Execution behavior is validated against nominal workflows and boundary edge cases.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(log N)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N)` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.cpp` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O3 main.cpp -o runner && ./runner
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `K-D Tree Spatial Partitioning and Nearest Neighbor Search` in `C++`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
